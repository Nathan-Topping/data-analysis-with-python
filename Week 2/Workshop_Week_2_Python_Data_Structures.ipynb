    "### Python Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "In Week 1, we introduced the concept of Python lists - a way to store multiple values in a single variable. This week, we'll expand on lists and explore other important data structures in Python: tuples, sets, and dictionaries. Each of these structures has its own unique properties and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data structures are different ways of organising data. For example, if you are writing a shopping list you might just jot down each item one after another. The order doesn’t matter much — you only need to remember what to buy. But if you wanted to keep your friends’ addresses, that approach wouldn’t be very helpful; you’d want to be able to quickly find the address of a particular friend. To do that, you might label each address with the friend’s name, and then you can look it up directly when you need it. Similarly, Python provides different data structures to organise and work with different kinds of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in the module, we’ll spend a lot of time working with pandas DataFrames, which are powerful tools for handling tabular data. However, it is still important to understand the basic Python data structures such as lists, dictionaries, sets and tuples and there will be times when you need to make use of them. Knowing these will make it much easier to understand how pandas works and to write clean, efficient code for data analysis."
