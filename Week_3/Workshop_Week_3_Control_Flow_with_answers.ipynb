    "# Control Flow in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous weeks, we've learned about variables, functions, and data structures in Python. Now, we'll explore how to control the flow of our programs using conditional statements and loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Control flow refers to the order in which the computer executes statements in a program. Python, like most programming languages, uses control structures to determine which parts of code to execute and when. These structures allow us to make decisions, repeat tasks, and organise our code in a logical way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're following a recipe to bake a cake. The recipe might say \"If the batter is too thick, add more milk\" or \"Beat the eggs until they're fluffy.\" These are examples of control flow in everyday life - conditional statements and loops that determine what actions to take and when to stop."
