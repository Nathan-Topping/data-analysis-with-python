    "# Week 4: An Introduction to Functions, Modules, and Libraries in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Week 4! In our previous sessions, we explored Python's fundamental building blocks: basic syntax, data structures, and control flow. Now, we will learn how to package our code into reusable and organised blocks. This week, we will focus on three essential concepts that are crucial for writing clean, efficient, and scalable Python code: **functions**, **modules**, and **libraries**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand these concepts, let's use an analogy: imagine you have a toolbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **A Function is like a single tool in your toolbox.** A specific tool, like a hammer or a screwdriver, performs a specific job. Similarly, a function is a block of code that performs a single, well-defined task. You can use it over and over again whenever you need to perform that task.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **A Module is like a compartment in your toolbox.** A well-organized toolbox might have separate compartments for different types of tools (e.g., one for electrical tools, one for plumbing tools). In Python, a module is a file containing a set of related functions and variables. It helps you group related code together, keeping your projects tidy and manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **A Library is the entire toolbox itself.** The toolbox contains all your compartments and tools. In Python, a library (or package) is a collection of related modules. Python comes with a vast **Standard Library** full of essential tools, and you can also install third-party libraries created by other developers to add even more powerful capabilities to your programs. In the coming weeks, we will be using powerful data science libraries like NumPy and Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mastering these concepts is the key to moving from writing simple scripts to building complex and powerful applications. Let's open our toolbox and get started!"

    "## 1. Functions: Your Reusable Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a named, reusable block of code that performs a specific, well-defined task. Think of it as a specialised tool in your toolbox. Instead of writing the same set of instructions every time you need to perform a common task, you can define a function once and then \"call\" it by name whenever you need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has several key advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Modularity:** It breaks down a complex problem into smaller, manageable pieces.\n",
    "*   **Reusability:** It saves you from re-writing the same code, reducing errors and saving time.\n",
    "*   **Readability:** It makes your code cleaner and easier to understand, as the function's name can describe its purpose."
